"""A tool to quickly organize your scenes."""

== Overview ==
The Asset Checker tool allows you to quickly relink missing assets and copy assets to subfolders in a specified directory.
At the top of the UI you will find a Status message with how many assets your scene contains and how many of them are missing.
All the settings that you enter will be saved in a config file so you don't have to re-enter them.
If needed you can also delete assets from the list by selecting them and pressing ((Delete)).

== Tips ==
If you want to delete assets from the list you can select them and press ((Delete)). 
In case you deleted something by accident just click the [Icon:BUTTONS/reload] button to re-parse the scene.

If you want some specific assets in specific folders you can select them and change the subfolder name in the *Config*. 
If you select multiple asset types (i.e. textures, geometry or simulation files) you just have to ender the same folder name for each type.


@parameters

::[Icon:BUTTONS/gear_mini]: 
    * ((LMB)) Open settings.
    
    * ((Shift + LMB)) Open config.
    
::[Icon:BUTTONS/reload]:
    Re-parses the scene.
    
::Relink:
    * ((LMB)) Searches for all files in the specified *Search* directory and relinks all found assets.
    
    * ((Shift + LMB)) Same functionality as ((LMB)) but for selected assets.
    
    * ((Ctrl + LMB)) Populates the *New Path* column with a preview of the resulting path. (Does not relink assets)
    
    * ((Ctrl + Shift + LMB)) Same functionality as ((Ctrl + LMB)) but for selected assets.
    
::Copy:
    * ((LMB)) Copies all assets to the specified *Target* directory.
    
    * ((Shift + LMB)) Same functionality as ((LMB)) but for selected assets.
    
== Settings ==
::Search:
    Specifies the path that is recursively searched for files.
    
    Accepts literal paths or variables. (`$HIP`, `$JOB` or a custom variable)
    
::Target:
    Specifies the path that files are copied to.
    
    Accepts literal paths or variables. (`$HIP`, `$JOB` or a custom variable)

::Only relink missing Assets:
    If this option is enabled only textures that are missing can be relinked.
    
    To relink textures regardless if they are missing or not, deactivate this option.
    
== Config ==
::Tex Folder:
    Specifies the texture folder name that is created inside the Target path.
    
::Geo Folder:
    Specifies the geometry folder name that is created inside the Target path.
    
::Sim Folder:
    Specifies the simulation folder name that is created inside the Target path.]]></helpText>

    <helpText><![CDATA[= Material Importer =

"""Quickly import textures and build shading networks."""

== Overview ==
The Material Importer tool allows you to quickly import textures and automatically build the shading network + OGL tags for the viewport.
The tool works with a variety of naming conventions, although there are some things to take into consideration.

== Naming Conventions for Textures == 
Multiple resolutions should be placed in subfolders, otherwise the script will prompt you to do manual selections of which textures you wanna use.

The texture name should not contain texture type names multiple times. 
For example: `metalpaint_diffuse.exr, metalpaint_spec.exr, etc.` are fine but `metal_paint_diffuse.exr, metal_paint_spec.exr, etc.` aren't.
The difference here is that the word "metal" is separated by an underscore, so the script will assume that all textures are of type metal and will fail to load your textures properly.

Here is a list of all names that should be avoided being used as a separated word:
`"diffuse", "diff", "albedo", "color", "col", "alb", "dif", "basecolor", 
"ao", "ambientocclusion", "ambient_occlusion", "cavity", 
"specular", "spec", "s", "refl", "reflectivity", 
"roughness", "rough", "r", "gloss", "g", "glossiness",
"metal", "metalness", "m", "metallic",
"transparency", "t", "opacity", "o",
"emission", "emissive",
"normal", "nrm", "nrml", "n", "norm_ogl", "normalbump",
"bump", "bmp", "height", "h",
"displacement", "displace", "disp"`

Once again, it's totally fine using those words if they are NOT enclosed by `/ - and _`. For example `"_diffuse_", "-diffuse-" or ".diffuse."`.
This only matters if the name is not describing the actual texture type.

@parameters

::Renderer: 
    Choose the Renderer you want to import the textures with.
    
::Jump to Material:
    Jumps into the last created material builder.
    
== Settings ==
::Prefer EXR:
    Chooses EXR over any other type if there are multiple texture types.
    
::Prefer Metal Textures:
    Chooses metal textures over others if there is more than one texture type that defines reflectivity.

::Enable UDIM:
    Enable this option when importing UDIM textures.
    Disable on everything else.
    
::Height is Displacement:
    Height textures will be considered as displacement instead of bump.
    
::Opacity as Stencil:
    Opacity will be treated as a cutout mask.
    
    WARNING:
        Redshift and VRay only.
        
::Diffuse is Linear:
    Enable this option if diffuse textures are linear.
    
    WARNING:
        Octane, Redshift and VRay only.
        
::Color Correction on Diffuse:
    Automatically creates a CC node for the diffuse texture.
    
::Auto Tri-Planar:
    Automatically creates a tri-planar shading network.
    
::Manual Texture Selection:
    Manually select the textures you want to import. This is mainly a last resort option if the automatic import fails.
    
::Apply to Selected Objects:
    Automatically applies the material to all selected objects after it is created.
    
::Use Environment Variable:
    Enable this option to get relative texture paths.
    
::Use Vertex Displacement:
    Use Vertex Displacement instead of Voxel Displacement.
    
    WARNING:
        Octane only.]]></helpText>
